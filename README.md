This project is a modest introduction to the world of cybersecurity.

It's a Capture The Flag (CTF) where the goal is to find a `flag` which is basically a password to access the next level.

The CTF takes place on a virtual machine which ISO is provided by 42.

In each `levelXX` directory there will be a `flag` file which contains the actual flag to pass to the next level and a `ressources` directory with a readme that explains the reasoning behind finding the flag and some additional ressources, such as scripts or text files, that helped finding the flag.
